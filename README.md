# Weather Forecast

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- This project challenge was to build a weather app using both a weather api and local storage.
- The app show both the current weather and a five day forecast of whatever city you search.
- There is also a search history to quickly look through previous results.
- Due to Utahs weather instead of humidity I chose to display wind information.
- I learned how to interact with local storage. If I were to do this again I would save more data to local storage and break the api call down into smaller functions.

## Usage

Live Page: https://jacob-aston.github.io/weather-forecast/

Repository: https://github.com/Jacob-Aston/weather-forecast

The page loads on my home town of West Valley City.

<img alt="Page loaded on West Valley City. Showing the current weather and a five day forecast." src="https://github.com/Jacob-Aston/weather-forecast/blob/main/assets/images/page-on-load.png?raw=true">

Using the search bar you can look up other cities.

Seached cities will display as buttons under the search bar. The "search history" is currently limited to five cities and isnt styled.

<img alt="Search bar and save button with search history buttons below them." src="https://github.com/Jacob-Aston/weather-forecast/blob/main/assets/images/search-history.png?raw=true">

Clicking on previously searched cities will display their weather information on the page. Clicking the "Clear History" button will remove the search history buttons. As well as clearing the local storage.
